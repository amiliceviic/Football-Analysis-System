## ✨ Overview

Unlock the potential of sports analytics with the **Football-Analysis-System**, a powerful framework for tracking and analyzing football dynamics through advanced computer vision techniques.

**Why Football-Analysis-System?**

This project aims to enhance the analysis of football gameplay by providing robust tools for object detection and tracking. The core features include:

- 🎯 **Object Detection:** Utilizes a pre-trained YOLO model for accurate identification of players and the ball.
- 🏃 **Player and Ball Tracking:** Processes video frames to track movements, offering insights into gameplay dynamics.
- ⏱️ **Speed and Distance Estimation:** Calculates speed and distance for tracked objects, providing valuable performance metrics.
- 🎨 **Team Color Assignment:** Automatically assigns team colors to players, improving visual differentiation in analysis.
- 📷 **Camera Movement Estimation:** Analyzes camera motion to enhance tracking accuracy in dynamic environments.
- 📓 **User-Friendly Training Notebook:** Simplifies the training of YOLOv5 on custom datasets, making model training accessible to all developers.
